	<h1>Principles of Design Assignment</h1>
	<h2>seanhalpin.io homepage</h2>
	<img src="Example1.png" alt="Website example screenshot-seanhalpin.io" />
	<ul> 
		<li>First, this portfolio website is a very good example of having a good <b>Signal-to-Noise Ratio</b>. The design is very simple and there are only three tabs from which to choose from when you first arrive on the page.</li>
			
		<li>Second, it is a good example of <b>Hick's Law</b>. Hick's Law states that the user should always try to reduce the number of decisions involved. This website has only three decision and you start out on one of them.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>This screenshot is a good example of how to effectively <b>Chunk</b> important information. Sean keeps it clear and concise and chunks together his information for easy and quick reading for the user.</li>
	</ul>

	<img src="Example3.png" alt="Website example screenshot-seanhalpin.io" />
	<ul>
		<li>His use and placement of the "Message Me" button is a good use of the <b>Mapping</b> principle. It has one function and fits in with the layout of the rest of the homepage.</li>
		
		<li>Along with that, the design of his "Message Me" button is also a good use of the <b>Affordance</b> principle. It has a little mail symbol, a box around the words, "Message Me" and that box is a different color than the rest of the background, while still being designed to go with the theme of the homepage.</li>	
	</ul>
