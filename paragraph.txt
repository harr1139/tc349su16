Throughout this process, I was very excited to be able to begin laying out actual designs for my website. Starting out with the style tiles, I definitely found it helpful to lay out all of the colors and possible backgrounds that I wanted to use. It made making the mockup a lot quicker since I already knew what color pallette I was following and how I wanted to layout my homepage. Personally, though, I think the full comps are a lot more useful for me because it allows me to see what the actual design looks like and if it flows together as well as lay everything out on a page and lets me see if anything needs to be fixed. The style tiles took me longer to complete mostly because I worked with a template and it was hard to manipulate, but after the first, the second one went a lot more smoothly. Also, as stated above, because of the style tiles, the homepage mockup took a lot less time than it would have if I did not plan it all out beforehand.
